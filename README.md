# Network Automation Toolkit

**Automate, Monitor, and Optimize Network Operations with Python and Ansible**

## üìñ Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of scripts, playbooks, and configurations for network automation tasks. The aim is to streamline network management, reduce manual effort, and improve overall network efficiency. This toolkit covers tasks such as device configuration, network health checks, backups, and troubleshooting.

## üîß Key Features

- **Automated Network Configuration:** Automate configuration of routers, switches, and firewalls across multiple vendors (Cisco, Juniper, etc.).
- **Real-Time Network Monitoring:** Track device status, BGP/OSPF neighbor state, interface errors, and latency using Python and SNMP.
- **Backups & Restores:** Automatically back up device configurations to a remote server and restore when needed.
- **Network Topology Mapping:** Visualize your network topology and identify potential optimizations.
- **Custom Alerts:** Set up notifications for critical network events such as interface down or high CPU usage.

## üìú Scripts & Playbooks

| File                | Description                                            |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `config_backup.py`  | Back up router/switch configurations to a server       |
| `bgp_health_check.py` | Monitor BGP neighbor states and log any changes     |
| `ansible_router_config.yml` | Ansible playbook for batch router configuration |
| `interface_status_report.py` | Generate a report on interface status and errors |
| `snmp_device_monitor.py` | Monitor devices using SNMP for key performance indicators |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python** (Netmiko, Nornir, Paramiko, SNMP libraries)
- **Ansible** (Playbooks for automated device configuration)
- **Cisco IOS/Juniper Junos** (Network device operating systems)
- **Docker** (Containerization for lab environments)

## üìù Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+**
2. **Ansible** (for configuration playbooks)
3. **Network Device Access** ‚Äì Devices should be accessible via SSH and configured for SNMP (if applicable).

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-automation-toolkit.git
   cd network-automation-toolkit
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure the environment:
   - Update device IP addresses, credentials, and SNMP community strings in `config.yaml`.
   - Modify any necessary parameters in each script based on your network setup.

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Configuration Backup**
   - Run `config_backup.py` to back up configurations of all devices.
   ```bash
   python config_backup.py
   ```

2. **BGP Health Check**
   - Monitor BGP states across your network and log any state changes:
   ```bash
   python bgp_health_check.py
   ```

3. **Apply Configuration with Ansible**
   - Use `ansible_router_config.yml` to apply configurations to multiple routers.
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook ansible_router_config.yml
   ```

## üìä Example Output

- **Configuration Backup:**
  ```
  [2023-10-24 10:15:32] Backup successful for device 192.168.1.1
  [2023-10-24 10:15:45] Backup successful for device 192.168.1.2
  ```

- **BGP Health Check:**
  ```
  [2023-10-24 11:00:00] BGP neighbor 10.10.10.1 state changed to Established
  ```
